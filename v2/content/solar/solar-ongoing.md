# Going Solar: The Bottom Line

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

## The Bottom Line

The bottom line is an ongoing and ever-evolving thing. Money will likely continue to go out to pay for electricity, although hopefully at reduced amounts. After all the one-time incentives are received, money should come in periodically from SREC sales.

### System

The system, in a nutshell:

* sixteen (16) 245W SunPower [SPR-245NE-WHT-U-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/spec-sheets/sp-e-series-residential-solar-panels-supplementary-technical-spec.pdf) (PDF) panels
* a SunPower [SPR-3801f-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/manuals/mn-spr-3301f-1-spr-3801f-1-spr-6501f-1-spr-7501f-1-spr-10001f-1-spr-11401f-1-spr-11401f-3-spr-12001f.pdf) (PDF) inverter

The system is designed to produce 114,400 kWh over its 25-year service lifetime.

### Costs

All in, the system cost was **$16,964**. That includes panels, inverter, materials, permits, labor, monitoring, service, etc.

To date, I've received $500 back from several sources:

* $500 "thank you" gift card from SEW
* $5,089 Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit (30% of 16,964)


That makes my out-of-pocket cost **$11,375**.

I'm still expecting the following credits:

* $1,000 Residential Clean Energy Grant Program (fixed)
* $2,500 Solar Equipment Property Tax Credit (fixed)
* $3,040 in [SREC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate) sales over the first 14 years (assuming 40&cent; on the dollar of [SACP](http://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-pricing/solar-alternative-compliance-payment-sacp))

So the out-of-pocket cost *should* be $5,335.

### Energy

Since installation and activation (about 3 months ago), my solar PV system has generated about 700 kWh.

#### After Three Months

In the first billing month, the system generated a mere 10% of my electrical needs, in part due to a end-of-cycle install in the middle of winter. We had some particularly snowy days where it took a day or two for the snow to melt and slide off the panels.

In the second month, the system generated 45% and then in the third month produced 79% of my needs. As the days grow longer and grey skies begin to clear, production will continue to increase.

I experienced an odd hardware failure after a particularly cold and nasty ice storm, where the inverter wouldn't sync for a few days. Solar Energy World came out to troubleshoot, got in touch with SunPower, and replaced the inverter a few days later. Sometimes motherboards go bad.
