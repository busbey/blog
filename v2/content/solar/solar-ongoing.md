# Going Solar: The Bottom Line

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

## The Bottom Line

The bottom line is an ongoing and ever-evolving thing. Money will likely continue to go out to pay for electricity, although hopefully at reduced amounts. After all the one-time incentives are received, money should come in periodically from SREC sales.

### System

The system, in a nutshell:

* sixteen (16) 245W SunPower [SPR-245NE-WHT-U-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/spec-sheets/sp-e-series-residential-solar-panels-supplementary-technical-spec.pdf) (PDF) panels
* a SunPower ([SPR-3801f-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/manuals/mn-spr-3301f-1-spr-3801f-1-spr-6501f-1-spr-7501f-1-spr-10001f-1-spr-11401f-1-spr-11401f-3-spr-12001f.pdf)) (PDF) inverter

### Costs

All in, the system cost was **$16,964**. That includes panels, inverter, materials, labor, monitoring, service, etc.

To date, I've received $500 back from several sources:

* $500 "thank you" gift card from SEW

That makes my out-of-pocket cost **$16,464**.

I'm still expecting the following:

* $5,089 Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit (30% of 16,964)
* $1,000 Residential Clean Energy Grant Program (fixed)
* $2,500 Solar Equipment Property Tax Credit (fixed)
* $3,040 in SREC sales over the first 14 years (assuming 40&cent; on the dollar)

So the out-of-pocket cost *should* be $5,335.

### Energy

Once the system is activated, details about production will follow.

Since installation and activation, my solar system has generated XXX kWh; this represents XX% of my electricity needs.
