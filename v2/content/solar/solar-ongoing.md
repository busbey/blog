# Going Solar: The Bottom Line

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

## The Bottom Line

The bottom line is an ongoing and ever-evolving thing. Money will likely continue to go out to pay for electricity, although hopefully at reduced amounts. After all the one-time incentives are received, money should come in periodically from SREC sales.

### System

The system, in a nutshell:

* sixteen (16) 245W SunPower [SPR-245NE-WHT-U-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/spec-sheets/sp-e-series-residential-solar-panels-supplementary-technical-spec.pdf) (PDF) panels
* a SunPower [SPR-3801f-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/manuals/mn-spr-3301f-1-spr-3801f-1-spr-6501f-1-spr-7501f-1-spr-10001f-1-spr-11401f-1-spr-11401f-3-spr-12001f.pdf) (PDF) inverter

The system is designed to produce 114,400 kWh over its 25-year service lifetime.

### Costs

All in, the system cost was **$16,965**. That includes panels, inverter, materials, permits, labor, monitoring, service, postage for grant applications, etc.

To date, I've received $5,704 back from several sources:

* $5,089 Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit (30% of 16,964)
* $1,000 Residential Clean Energy Grant Program (one time)
* $500 "thank you" gift card from SEW
* $196 in utility bill reductions (from energy I generated rather than bought)
* $10 in utility generation credits

That makes my out-of-pocket cost **$10,170**.

I'm still expecting the following credits:

* $2,500 Solar Equipment Property Tax Credit (fixed)
* $3,040 in [SREC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate) sales over the first 14 years (assuming 40&cent; on the dollar of [SACP](http://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-pricing/solar-alternative-compliance-payment-sacp))

So the out-of-pocket cost *should* be $5,335.

### Energy

Since installation and activation (about 3 months ago), my solar PV system has generated about 980 kWh.

#### After Three Months

In the first billing month, the system generated a mere 10% of my electrical needs, in part due to a end-of-cycle install in the middle of winter. We had some particularly snowy days where it took a day or two for the snow to melt and slide off the panels.

In the second month, the system generated 45% and then in the third month produced 79% of my needs. As the days grow longer and grey skies begin to clear, production will continue to increase.

In the third month, the system generated 143% resulting in a zeroed bill and nice credit from my utility company. BGE does a true-up at the end of April, and I received a check for the accrued generation.

#### After Six Months

After six months the system continues to generate a steady stream of electricity, usually more than I need on a daily basis. I expect the accrued credit balance with the utility should help even out the high-usage over the summer and the upcoming slowing production of fall and winter.

Since installation, the system has generated more than 86% of my electrical needs.

### Problems

I experienced [an odd hardware failure](/v2/solar/inverter-replacement.html) after a particularly cold and nasty ice storm, where the inverter wouldn't sync for a few days. Solar Energy World came out to troubleshoot, got in touch with SunPower, and replaced the inverter a few days later. Sometimes motherboards go bad or get confused, I guess.

I've seen the monitoring adapter stop reporting to SunPower. While it doesn't affect generation, the monitoring pages/apps are blank until I reboot the adapter (by unplugging it and plugging it back in again). The inverter appears to retain data from the previous day and the monitoring pages get filled in with the "missing" data. It's only happened once.
