# Going Solar: Frequently Asked Questions

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

Whether solar pays off for me or what its place in the energy market will be in the future, one thing is clear: many people have questions about solar. Throughout my solar journey, I've addressed a variety of questions.

Here are some of the questions that weren't answered elsewhere.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What was your electric bill like before?**

In 2014, my average electric usage was 450 kWh per month.

My electrical usage rises and falls with the seasons, rising in the warmer months when I use air conditioning and falling in the colder months when I use natural gas for heating.

**Q: What happens if the panels are damaged by hail?**

I carry enough coverage on my homeowner's insurance policy to cover the replacement cost of the system.
