# Going Solar: Activation

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

## The Waiting Game

While the system is installed and the panels are collecting the sun's energy, the electricity generated isn't going anywhere.

Before the system can be activated, both the building structure and electrical system need to be inspected by a county inspector. Once inspected, a copy of the inspection certificate will be sent to BGE along with a request for a net meter.

Once the net meter is installed and I get the OK from BGE, I get to flip the switch and start sending electricity back to the grid.

## Activation Day

Pending.

## After Activation

After activation, [Solar Energy World](www.solarenergyworld.com) pre-registers me for SREC payment processing with [SolSystems](http://www.solsystemscompany.com/). After I make my final payment, they will apply for my Maryland grant and send me the warranty booklet.
