# Going Solar: The System

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

## The System

The solar system is composed of solar panels, a mounting system, an inverter, a production meter, and a bunch of circuit breakers.

The solar panels convert the sun's energy into DC electricity, which the inverter then converts into AC; the electricity flows through a [production meter](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/15933619976/in/set-72157649099138418) (which only tracks electricity produced by the panels) and is then backfed through my electrical panel back onto the grid and measured by a bi-directional meter (which tracks electricity flowing from *and to* the grid).

Important to note, the solar panels don't provide electricity to my home directly; my home still consumes power from the grid, measured by the same meter. Battery backup systems do exist, but they're still quite expensive and error-prone. If my power goes out, the power is out.

### Panels

There are sixteen [SunPower](http://us.sunpower.com) E-20  [SPR-245NE-WHT-U-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/spec-sheets/sp-e-series-residential-solar-panels-supplementary-technical-spec.pdf) (PDF) modules, each generating 245W DC. They're about [five feet long](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/15934096556/in/set-72157649099138418), two and a half feet in width, and two inches thick; each weighs 33 pounds, putting 2.46 PSF onto my roof.

Each of the panels is warranted (both by SEW and the manufacturer) for 25 years.

### Mounting Rail

Six [Unirac rails](http://unirac.com/residential/residential-products/solar-mount-residential) are mounted vertically to the roof face, bolted to the top chord of the roof trusses using 3" x 5/16 stainless steel lag bolts. Each column of solar panels is attached to two rails.

### Inverter

A SunPower [SPR-3801f-240](http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/manuals/mn-spr-3301f-1-spr-3801f-1-spr-6501f-1-spr-7501f-1-spr-10001f-1-spr-11401f-1-spr-11401f-3-spr-12001f.pdf) (PDF) inverter is warranted by SunPower for 10 years, but also warranted by SEW for 25 years.
