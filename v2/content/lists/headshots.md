# Headshots

I'm that guy who usually has a camera. Every once in a while I discover that someone has used one of my photographs as a profile picture on social media.

I collect them all. Like playing cards. In a [dedicated Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/albums/72157656497347803), even.
